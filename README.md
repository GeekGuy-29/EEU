# Efficient Exhaust Unit
> In this mini project, I made an efficient cooling system. In simple words, it is a temperature controlled cooling system which will save the power required to run a cooling unit, increasing the efficiency and the sustainability of the system, resulting to an increase in the life of the machines being used in the unit. The idea of this project has been extracted from a problem case. The case can be described by elaborating on the situation of transport of dairy products. As we all know, dairy products or any temperature vulnerable product require controlled temperature of the transporting unit. Hence, with this project, we realised a system in which we can maintain the temperature of the carrying unit as well as make it power efficient and tenable. This Project will is a miniature version of a high scale finished product.

## Project Outline
> This project is carried out in an efficient and systematic manner. The methodology used in here is, Arduino UNO is used as the microcontroller that connects the sensor with the Input/Output devices. So, whenever the temperature in the unit fluctuates, it immediately checks if the fans’ speed have to be controlled or not. As programmed, of the temperature increases, the speed of the fan increases and as the temperature decreases, the speed of the fan decreases, Maintaining an adequate temperature in the unit as well as cooling it.

## Components used in this project
> Arduino UNO
> L298 Motor Driver
> DHT 11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
> 12 V DC Fan
> 12 VPower Source
> 16*2 LCD Display
> I2C Module and Jumper Cables

## Conclsion
> It’s mainly effective for cooling the units which contain any product that can get damaged due to moisture. As we know, there are dairy products, dry products which have to be kept away from moisture hence this concept would be efficient and come in handy to create a win-win situation. As the system is efficient enough, large amount of power can be saved and can be stored in any form or can be used in any other function of the unit.
